# Task: Intelligent Brainstorming Engine

## Description
Create the `/oden:brainstorm` command that provides interactive ideation sessions before PRD creation. This engine should ask contextual questions, suggest alternatives, identify risks, and seamlessly transition to PRD creation with refined requirements.

## Functional Requirements
- **Context-Aware Questions**: Generate questions based on project type and existing documentation
- **Alternative Suggestions**: Propose different approaches with trade-off analysis
- **Risk Identification**: Surface potential challenges and dependencies early
- **Interactive Conversation**: Continue dialogue until user is confident about direction
- **PRD Integration**: Seamlessly transition to enhanced `/oden:prd` workflow

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Create/Modify:
- `.claude/commands/oden/brainstorm.md` - Command definition
- `lib/commands/brainstorm.js` - Main command implementation
- `lib/brainstorm/question-generator.js` - Dynamic question generation
- `lib/brainstorm/context-analyzer.js` - Project and domain context analysis
- `lib/brainstorm/suggestion-engine.js` - Alternative approach suggestions
- `data/brainstorm-templates.json` - Question templates and patterns

### Architecture:
1. **Context Analysis**: Read existing docs, project structure, tech stack
2. **Question Generation**: Dynamic questions based on feature type and context
3. **Conversation Flow**: Iterative refinement through intelligent follow-ups
4. **Knowledge Base**: Industry best practices and common pitfalls database
5. **PRD Bridge**: Structured handoff to PRD creation process

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality:
- [ ] `/oden:brainstorm "user authentication"` starts interactive session
- [ ] Asks 5-8 intelligent questions adapted to project context
- [ ] Follows up when answers need clarification or expansion
- [ ] Suggests alternative approaches with pros/cons analysis
- [ ] Identifies potential risks and dependencies
- [ ] Provides competitive analysis insights when relevant
- [ ] Transitions smoothly to `/oden:prd` with refined requirements

### Question Intelligence:
- [ ] Questions adapt based on detected project type (web app, mobile, API)
- [ ] References existing project patterns and documentation
- [ ] Asks about scalability, security, and performance considerations
- [ ] Probes for edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] Considers integration points with existing systems
- [ ] Explores user experience and accessibility requirements

### Conversation Flow:
- [ ] Maintains context throughout the session
- [ ] Asks follow-up questions when answers are vague
- [ ] Suggests considerations user might not have thought of
- [ ] Provides examples and references where helpful
- [ ] Allows users to explore tangents and return to main flow
- [ ] Summarizes decisions and rationale at the end

### Knowledge Integration:
- [ ] References competitive analysis data for suggestions
- [ ] Incorporates industry best practices and standards
- [ ] Suggests relevant tools and technologies
- [ ] Identifies potential compliance or regulatory requirements
- [ ] Highlights common implementation pitfalls

## Dependencies
- **Internal**: Existing project documentation, competitive analysis data
- **External**: None (fully local operation)
- **Integration**: Enhanced `/oden:prd` command for seamless transition

## Implementation Notes
- Build conversation templates for common feature types
- Use project context to customize question relevance
- Implement conversation state management for continuity
- Create knowledge base of best practices and patterns
- Design clear transition mechanism to PRD creation

## Conversation Templates

### Authentication Features:
- What authentication methods do you want to support?
- How will you handle user registration and verification?
- What session management approach fits your architecture?
- How will you secure sensitive user data?
- What compliance requirements apply (GDPR, SOC2)?

### API Development:
- What data will your API expose and manage?
- How will you handle authentication and authorization?
- What rate limiting and scaling strategies do you need?
- How will you version your API for future changes?
- What monitoring and analytics do you require?

### User Interface:
- What devices and screen sizes need support?
- How important is accessibility compliance?
- What user interaction patterns fit your use case?
- How will you handle offline functionality?
- What personalization features are needed?

## Risks
- **Medium**: Questions might be too generic or irrelevant
- **Medium**: Conversation could become too lengthy or unfocused
- **Low**: Integration with PRD creation could be clunky

## Mitigation Strategies
- Extensive testing with various project types and features
- Clear conversation boundaries and time estimates
- Smooth handoff protocol to PRD creation
- User feedback collection for question refinement
