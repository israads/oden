# Task: Enhanced PRD Question System

## Description
Enhance the existing `/oden:prd` command with a deeper, more intelligent question system that generates 5-8 contextual questions instead of the current basic 3-5. Questions should adapt based on feature type, project context, and existing documentation while providing follow-up clarification when needed.

## Functional Requirements
- **Deeper Question Set**: Expand from 3-5 to 5-8 intelligent questions per PRD
- **Context Adaptation**: Questions adapt based on feature type and project context
- **Follow-up Logic**: Ask clarifying questions when answers need expansion
- **Consideration Prompts**: Suggest aspects user might not have considered
- **Reference Integration**: Include competitive analysis and existing project patterns

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Modify:
- `.claude/commands/oden/prd.md` - Enhanced command definition
- `lib/commands/prd.js` - Extended question generation logic
- `lib/prd/enhanced-questions.js` - New intelligent question system
- `lib/prd/context-adapter.js` - Project context analysis for question customization
- `data/prd-question-templates.json` - Expanded question database

### Architecture:
1. **Context Analysis**: Analyze project type, existing docs, tech stack
2. **Question Selection**: Choose relevant questions from expanded database
3. **Dynamic Follow-ups**: Generate clarifying questions based on initial answers
4. **Consideration Engine**: Suggest additional aspects to consider
5. **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing PRD workflow

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality:
- [ ] Enhanced `/oden:prd feature-name` generates 5-8 contextual questions
- [ ] Questions adapt based on detected project type (web, mobile, API, etc.)
- [ ] Follows up with clarifying questions when answers are incomplete
- [ ] References existing project documentation and patterns
- [ ] Maintains backward compatibility with existing PRD structure
- [ ] Integrates smoothly with `/oden:brainstorm` when used together

### Question Intelligence:
- [ ] Business impact questions (user value, success metrics, ROI)
- [ ] Technical complexity questions (scalability, performance, integration)
- [ ] User experience questions (accessibility, usability, edge cases)
- [ ] Risk assessment questions (security, compliance, dependencies)
- [ ] Timeline and resource questions (effort, skills, external dependencies)

### Context Adaptation Examples:

#### E-commerce Features:
- How will this affect conversion rates and user purchase flow?
- What payment processing and security requirements apply?
- How will inventory management integrate with this feature?
- What analytics and tracking capabilities are needed?

#### Authentication Features:
- What compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA) apply?
- How will this integrate with existing user management systems?
- What backup authentication methods should be available?
- How will you handle account recovery and security incidents?

#### API Features:
- What rate limiting and scaling strategies are needed?
- How will you maintain backward compatibility during updates?
- What documentation and developer experience is required?
- What monitoring and alerting capabilities are essential?

### Follow-up Logic:
- [ ] Detects vague answers and asks for specifics
- [ ] Identifies missing stakeholder considerations
- [ ] Prompts for success criteria when not provided
- [ ] Requests clarification on technical constraints
- [ ] Asks about user research or validation plans

### Integration Features:
- [ ] References competitive analysis data for context
- [ ] Incorporates existing project architecture decisions
- [ ] Suggests related features or dependencies
- [ ] Highlights potential conflicts with existing features
- [ ] Recommends complementary functionality

## Dependencies
- **Internal**: Existing `/oden:prd` command structure
- **Integration**: `/oden:brainstorm` for seamless transition
- **Data**: Competitive analysis files, technical decisions documentation

## Implementation Notes
- Maintain all existing PRD generation functionality
- Add question intelligence without breaking current workflows
- Create question templates that can be mixed and matched
- Implement answer analysis for follow-up generation
- Ensure generated PRDs remain compatible with `/oden:epic`

## Enhanced Question Categories

### Business & User Value:
- What specific user problem does this solve?
- How will you measure success and user adoption?
- What's the business impact and expected ROI?
- Who are the primary and secondary user personas?

### Technical Implementation:
- What technical constraints or dependencies exist?
- How will this integrate with existing architecture?
- What performance requirements must be met?
- What scalability considerations apply?

### User Experience:
- What accessibility requirements must be supported?
- How will users discover and learn this feature?
- What error states and edge cases need handling?
- What mobile and cross-platform requirements exist?

### Risk & Compliance:
- What security or privacy considerations apply?
- Are there regulatory or compliance requirements?
- What could cause this feature to fail or be rejected?
- What external dependencies pose risks?

## Risks
- **Medium**: Questions might overwhelm users with too much depth
- **Medium**: Context detection might generate irrelevant questions
- **Low**: Integration with brainstorming could create redundancy

## Mitigation Strategies
- Progressive disclosure: start with core questions, expand based on answers
- Clear categorization so users understand the purpose of each question
- Testing with various project types to refine question relevance
- Integration testing with brainstorming workflow to avoid duplication
