# Task: React Dashboard UI for Agent Monitoring

## Description
Create a modern React-based web interface for monitoring agent status, task queues, and development progress in real-time. This dashboard will connect to the local Express server and provide interactive controls for managing development workflows.

## Functional Requirements
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live agent status, task queues, and progress tracking
- **Interactive Controls**: Pause, resume, reorder, and detail views for tasks
- **Performance Metrics**: Historical trends, execution times, and success rates
- **Multi-Stream Visualization**: Parallel work stream coordination and dependencies
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Create:
- `web/src/App.js` - Main React application component
- `web/src/components/AgentMonitor.js` - Agent status monitoring interface
- `web/src/components/TaskQueue.js` - Task queue visualization and controls
- `web/src/components/PerformanceMetrics.js` - Charts and metrics dashboard
- `web/src/components/StreamCoordination.js` - Multi-stream workflow visualization
- `web/src/hooks/useWebSocket.js` - WebSocket connection management
- `web/src/hooks/useAgentData.js` - Agent data state management
- `web/public/index.html` - Dashboard HTML template and assets

### Modern React Architecture:
- **React 18**: Latest React features with concurrent rendering
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time data updates via custom hooks
- **State Management**: Context API + useReducer for complex state
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design
- **Charts**: Chart.js or Recharts for performance visualization
- **Icons**: React Icons for consistent iconography

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Dashboard Features:
- [ ] Loads in <3 seconds with responsive design
- [ ] Real-time updates via WebSocket with <500ms latency
- [ ] Displays all active agents with current status and progress
- [ ] Shows task queue with priority, dependencies, and estimated time
- [ ] Provides interactive controls for task management
- [ ] Historical performance metrics with charts and trends

### Agent Monitoring Interface:
- [ ] Real-time agent status (idle, running, completed, error)
- [ ] Current task details and progress percentage
- [ ] Agent resource usage (memory, CPU, execution time)
- [ ] Agent logs and output streaming
- [ ] Color-coded status indicators and health monitoring
- [ ] Agent restart and configuration controls

### Task Queue Management:
- [ ] Visual task queue with drag-and-drop reordering
- [ ] Task filtering by stream, status, and priority
- [ ] Detailed task view with requirements and progress
- [ ] Dependency visualization showing task relationships
- [ ] Pause/resume controls for individual tasks
- [ ] Task cancellation and retry capabilities

### Performance Metrics Dashboard:
- [ ] Real-time performance charts (execution time, success rate)
- [ ] Historical trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly)
- [ ] Agent efficiency comparisons and benchmarks
- [ ] Project progress tracking with milestone indicators
- [ ] Resource utilization monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Export capabilities for performance reports

### Multi-Stream Coordination:
- [ ] Visual representation of parallel work streams
- [ ] Dependency mapping between tasks and streams
- [ ] Stream progress tracking and completion estimates
- [ ] Conflict detection and resolution suggestions
- [ ] Team coordination features for shared projects

### Responsive Design:
- [ ] Desktop (1920x1080+): Full dashboard with all features
- [ ] Tablet (768x1024): Responsive layout with touch controls
- [ ] Mobile (375x667): Essential monitoring with simplified interface
- [ ] Dark/light mode toggle for user preference
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## User Experience Requirements

### Navigation and Layout:
- [ ] Intuitive navigation with clear information hierarchy
- [ ] Customizable dashboard layout with draggable panels
- [ ] Quick access toolbar for common actions
- [ ] Search functionality for tasks, agents, and logs
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for power users

### Real-time Feedback:
- [ ] Visual progress indicators for long-running tasks
- [ ] Toast notifications for important events
- [ ] Audio alerts for critical issues (optional)
- [ ] Status changes with smooth animations
- [ ] Connection status indicator for WebSocket

### Data Visualization:
- [ ] Clear, readable charts with proper scaling
- [ ] Color-blind friendly color palette
- [ ] Tooltips and hover states for detailed information
- [ ] Zoom and pan capabilities for historical data
- [ ] Export options for charts and data

## Dependencies
- **Internal**: Task 11 (Local server with WebSocket support)
- **External**: React 18, WebSocket API, Chart.js/Recharts, Tailwind CSS
- **Integration**: WebSocket server for real-time data streaming

## Implementation Notes

### Component Structure:
```
web/src/
├── App.js                 # Main application
├── components/
│   ├── AgentMonitor.js    # Agent status cards
│   ├── TaskQueue.js       # Task list and controls
│   ├── PerformanceMetrics.js # Charts and metrics
│   ├── StreamCoordination.js # Multi-stream view
│   └── common/            # Shared UI components
├── hooks/
│   ├── useWebSocket.js    # WebSocket connection
│   ├── useAgentData.js    # Agent state management
│   └── usePerformance.js  # Performance data

│   └── constants.js       # App constants
└── styles/
    └── globals.css        # Global styles and Tailwind
```

### WebSocket Data Flow:
```javascript
// Real-time data structure from server
{
  type: 'agent_status_update',
  data: {
    agentId: 'security-agent-001',
    status: 'running',
    progress: 45,
    currentTask: 'Scanning authentication modules',
    estimatedTime: '2 minutes remaining'
  }
}
```

### Performance Optimization:
- React.memo for expensive components
- Virtualization for large task lists
- Debounced search and filtering
- Lazy loading for historical data
- WebSocket message batching for high-frequency updates

## Risks
- **High**: Complex real-time UI might have performance issues
- **Medium**: WebSocket connection reliability could affect user experience
- **Medium**: Browser compatibility issues with modern React features

## Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive performance testing and optimization
- Robust WebSocket reconnection and fallback strategies
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
- Extensive cross-browser and device testing
