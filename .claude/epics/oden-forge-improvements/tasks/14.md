# Task: Specialized Agent System Design

## Description
Design and implement specialized agents for security auditing, performance optimization, and accessibility checking. These agents will integrate with the existing `/oden:work` orchestration system and provide detailed reports with actionable recommendations.

## Functional Requirements
- **Security Agent**: Audit code for common vulnerabilities and security best practices
- **Performance Agent**: Analyze code for performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **Accessibility Agent**: Check UI components for WCAG compliance and accessibility issues
- **SEO Agent**: Review content and structure for search engine optimization
- **Quality Agent**: General code quality metrics and improvement suggestions

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Create:
- `lib/agents/specialized/security-agent.js` - Security vulnerability scanning
- `lib/agents/specialized/performance-agent.js` - Performance analysis and recommendations
- `lib/agents/specialized/accessibility-agent.js` - A11y compliance checking
- `lib/agents/specialized/seo-agent.js` - SEO analysis and suggestions
- `lib/agents/specialized/quality-agent.js` - Code quality metrics
- `lib/agents/specialized/base-agent.js` - Base class for all specialized agents
- `lib/pipeline/agent-coordinator.js` - Agent orchestration and reporting

## Acceptance Criteria

### Security Agent:
- [ ] Scans for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- [ ] Checks for hardcoded secrets and credentials
- [ ] Validates input sanitization and SQL injection prevention
- [ ] Reviews authentication and authorization implementation
- [ ] Examines HTTPS usage and security headers
- [ ] Identifies potential XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities
- [ ] Provides remediation suggestions with code examples

### Performance Agent:
- [ ] Analyzes bundle size and identifies optimization opportunities
- [ ] Reviews database queries for N+1 problems and inefficiencies
- [ ] Examines component rendering patterns for unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Checks for memory leaks and resource management issues
- [ ] Reviews caching strategies and implementation
- [ ] Suggests performance improvements with impact estimates
- [ ] Benchmarks critical paths and provides timing analysis

### Accessibility Agent:
- [ ] Validates semantic HTML structure and ARIA labels
- [ ] Checks color contrast ratios for WCAG compliance
- [ ] Reviews keyboard navigation and focus management
- [ ] Examines screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Validates form labels and error messaging accessibility
- [ ] Checks for missing alt text and image descriptions
- [ ] Provides specific WCAG guideline references for violations

### SEO Agent:
- [ ] Analyzes meta tags and structured data implementation
- [ ] Reviews URL structure and internal linking
- [ ] Checks for proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
- [ ] Examines page load performance impact on SEO
- [ ] Validates sitemap and robots.txt configuration
- [ ] Reviews content structure for search engine optimization
- [ ] Suggests improvements for Core Web Vitals metrics

### Quality Agent:
- [ ] Measures code complexity and maintainability metrics
- [ ] Reviews code style consistency and best practices
- [ ] Analyzes test coverage and quality
- [ ] Examines dependency health and security
- [ ] Reviews documentation completeness
- [ ] Checks for code duplication and refactoring opportunities
- [ ] Provides overall project health score and trends

### Integration Features:
- [ ] Seamless integration with existing `/oden:work` orchestration
- [ ] Configurable agent selection and execution order
- [ ] Detailed reporting with actionable recommendations
- [ ] Progress tracking and real-time feedback
- [ ] Historical analysis and trend reporting

## Dependencies
- **Internal**: Task 1 (Bug diagnosis system for context), existing agent orchestration
- **External**: Static analysis tools (ESLint, Lighthouse, axe-core), Node.js APIs
- **Integration**: Existing `/oden:work` command infrastructure

## Implementation Notes

### Agent Architecture:
```javascript
class BaseSpecializedAgent {
  constructor(config) {
    this.config = config;
    this.results = [];
  }

  async analyze(project) {
    // Base analysis framework
  }

  async generateReport() {
    // Standardized reporting format
  }

  async getSuggestions() {
    // Actionable recommendations
  }
}
```

### Report Structure:
```json
{
  "agent": "security",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-18T20:37:25Z",
  "summary": {
    "score": 85,
    "issues_found": 3,
    "critical_issues": 1,
    "recommendations": 5
  },
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "high",
      "category": "authentication",
      "file": "src/auth/login.js",
      "line": 42,
      "description": "Hardcoded API key detected",
      "recommendation": "Move API keys to environment variables",
      "fix_suggestion": "process.env.API_KEY"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Tool Integration:
- **Security**: Semgrep, ESLint security plugin, npm audit
- **Performance**: Lighthouse, Bundle Analyzer, Clinic.js
- **Accessibility**: axe-core, Pa11y, Lighthouse accessibility audit
- **SEO**: Lighthouse SEO audit, Meta tag analyzer
- **Quality**: ESLint, SonarJS, complexity analysis tools

## Risks
- **High**: False positives might overwhelm developers with irrelevant issues
- **Medium**: Analysis might be too slow for large codebases
- **Medium**: Tool integration complexity could cause reliability issues

## Mitigation Strategies
- Implement confidence scoring to prioritize real issues
- Optimize analysis performance with incremental and parallel processing
- Provide clear filtering and customization options
- Extensive testing with various project types and sizes
- Graceful degradation when external tools are unavailable
